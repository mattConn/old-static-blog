<h2>About</h2>
<p>I'm Matthew Connelly; a web developer with a BS in communications from The College of Staten Island. I'm currently pursuing a BS in computer science at the same college, and I previously worked as a web developer for The Charles NYC.</p>
<p>This website serves mainly as a blog where I write about <a href="http://git.mattconn.io/">projects</a> I've been working on and anything interesting I might discover during the development process, as well as a landing page where I keep links and information of interest and pertaining to myself.</p>
