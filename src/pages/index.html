# About

I’m a software developer with a BS in communications from The College of Staten Island, currently pursuing a BS in computer science at the same college. Previously, I worked as a web developer for The Charles NYC. 

I enjoy programming in JavaScript, C/C++, and more recently, Python.  

This website serves mainly as a blog where I write about projects I’ve been working on and anything interesting I might discover during development.
