#About

I’m a web developer with a BS in communications from The College of Staten Island, currently pursuing a BS in computer science at the same college. Previously, I worked as a web developer for The Charles NYC. 

I enjoy programming in C/C++, JavaScript and more recently, Python. My prior work experience is mainly with the frontend stack (HTML, CSS, JavaScript), and from there my interest in programming grew enough to encourage me to return to school in order to strengthen my knowledge of computers and programming, as well as a newfound interest in mathematics. 

This website serves mainly as a blog where I write about projects I’ve been working on and anything interesting I might discover during development.
