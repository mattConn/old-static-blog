<h1>TI-BASIC Development on Linux</h1>
<img src="/assets/images/blog/calc.jpeg" alt="TI-83 Calculator Buttons" style="margin-bottom: 20px">
<p>Here's my setup for programming in TI-BASIC on Linux (Debian).</p>

<h2>Connecting the TI-83 to Your Computer</h2>
<h3>Dealing with Connectivity Issues</h3>

<ul>
<li><p>I used <b>tilp</b> to connect my TI-83 to my computer (downloadable via apt-get) with a GraphLink cable.</p></li>
<li><p>In menu option file&gt;change device, set cable to "Silver Link" (the alternative name for the GraphLink cable, found via <code>lsusb</code>).</p></li>
<li><p>Port was left at "#1", Calc was set to TI83+, and I checked "USB scan at startup".</p></li>
<li><p>After tilp was unable to detect my TI-83, I checked to make sure the GraphLink cable was being detected by my computer with <code>lsusb</code>; it was, and in the end, it was a matter of unplugging and plugging it in to the USB port (which needs to be USB 2.0, or non-blue USB port) to get tilp to detect it, and refreshing the directory listing in tilp.</p></li>
</ul>

<h2>Compiling and Testing</h2>

<ul>
	<li><p>I used the <a href="http://tibasic.sourceforge.net/">tibasic compiler</a> to compile from ASCII to .8xp files. This required WINE, as I didn't try to build from source (not sure if the build would be natively Linux compatible anyway), and just used the .exe binary.</p></li>
	<li><p>For this compiler, the token for the <b>negation operator</b> (for negative numbers) is <code>[neg]</code> by default (found in "tokens.cpp" for tibasic-1.4.2 source), and not the typical dash (neither em-dash nor en-dash).</p></li>
	<li><p>For testing with ASCII files:</p></li>
		<ul>
			<li><p>I use <a href="https://github.com/lunixbochs/pitybas">pitybas</a>. One issue with pitybas is that it doesn't recognize <code>[neg]</code> as the negation operator but uses a dash (the opposite of what the tibasic compiler wants). So your TI-BASIC will compile fine with the tibasic compiler and use of <code>[neg]</code>, but pitybas won't be able to parse it. This isn't breaking but not exactly convenient, and can be circumvented a few different ways. Still, pitybas is a nice .tib file interpreter written in python.</p></li>
		</ul>
	<li><p>For testing with compiled .8xp files:</p></li>
		<ul>
			<li><p>I use <b>tilem</b>, a TI calculator emulator (available via apt-get). You will need a calculator ROM (you can dump your own from your calculator via tilp), or you can download one; I downloaded one from <a href="https://www.emuparadise.me/M.A.M.E._-_Multiple_Arcade_Machine_Emulator_ROMs/TI-83_Plus/180976-download">here</a>.</p></li>
