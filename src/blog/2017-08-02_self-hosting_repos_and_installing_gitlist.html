<h1>Self-Hosting Git Repos and Installing GitList for a Web Interface</h1>
<img src="/assets/images/blog/git_logo.png" alt="Git logo" style="margin-bottom: 20px">
<p>Hosting your git repositories yourself is as simple as <code>git init --bare</code> (or <code>git clone --bare</code> for existing repos) in a directory on your server, and then adding the remote to your local repo: <code>git remote add myServer ssh://me@server.address/path/to/repo/project.git</code>.  </p>
<p>Having your repos on GitHub too makes for a nice redundancy (or on any other git server), and a remote on your server, on GitHub and a local copy makes for three redundancies. You can push to multiple remotes by adding a few lines in your project's git config.</p>
<p>In your local copy of the repo, edit <code>.git/config</code> and add a new block:</p>
<pre><code>[remote "all"]
    url = ssh://me@server.address/path/to/repo/project.git
    url = git@github.com:me/project
</code></pre><p>That would be the url for your server and for GitHub's. And so now when you're ready to push, <code>git push all &lt;branch_name&gt;</code> will push your changes to both repositories. It should be noted that you can name this remote whatever you want.</p>

<h4 id="using-nginx-server-on-debian-9-">(Using Nginx server on Debian 9)</h4>
<p>For a nice way to show your code and commits much like GitHub does, there are many <a href="https://git.wiki.kernel.org/index.php/Interfaces,_frontends,_and_tools#Web_Interfaces">git web interfaces</a> out there, but I chose <a href="http://gitlist.org/">GitList</a> because it looked pretty good and seemed pretty easy to set up.</p>
<p>I used Nginx for my server, so I followed GitList's <code>INSTALL.md</code> instructions for Nginx, copying their provided configuration.<br>Here are some issues I encountered and their solutions:</p>
<h2 id="getting-a-500-error-when-trying-to-view-repos">Getting a 500 error when trying to view repos:</h2>
<p>Assuming you're using php-fpm, you'll need to note the address in GitList's Nginx config, within the php location block, listed as <code>fastcgi_pass</code>:
<pre><code>location ~* ^/index.php.*$ {
    fastcgi_pass 127.0.0.1:9000;
}
</code></pre><p>Then open <code>/etc/php/7.0/fpm/pool.d/www.conf</code> and find the line <code>listen = /run/php/php7.0-fpm.sock</code>; here you're going to change the listed socket to the address in our Nginx location block above so that it reads as: <code>listen = 127.0.0.1:9000</code>.</p>
<p>After restarting php-fpm, you should no longer receive a 500 error when viewing repos.</p>
<h2 id="getting-blank-screen-500-error-when-trying-to-view-commits">Getting blank screen (500 error) when trying to view commits:</h2>
<p>This error persisted for a bit longer than the above for me, but looking at the error log (always check the error log!), I noticed this:</p>
<pre><code>FastCGI sent in stderr: "PHP message: PHP Fatal error:  Uncaught Error: Class 'SimpleXmlIterator' not found in /var/www/gitlist/vendor/klaussilveira/gitter/lib/Gitter/PrettyFormat.php:22
</code></pre>
<p>Searching for <code>'SimpleXmlIterator' not found</code> online lead me to find that I needed to install <code>php7.0-xml</code>, which I was able to do with apt-get, which solved the issue.</p>
